# Connecting The Dots

by Reisha Zang and Kathryn Brooks 

For decades scientists have struggled with explaining what causes some individuals to be more creative than others. While that still remains a mystery, common traits have been easier to identify. Abilities such as being keen observers of human nature, taking risks, seeking out new experiences and following their true passions top the list. Creative types are innately curious and possess the ability to see possibilities where others don't. They connect the dots that others might never think to connect. With those talents in mind, we introduce four Valley individuals: Gabriele Bertaccini, Terri Camberlango, Lea Cappelli and Teresa Wilson, each making creative connections and impacting our community in their own ways. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d7641987-b705-4026-9ecc-dd53602e725c.jpg)

At 13, Chef Gabriele Bertaccini had a job washing pots and pans at a restaurant in Florence, Italy. It wasn't dishwashing that excited him but a love of food that has driven him ever since. "Growing up in Florence and being Italian means food and wine is part of you; it defines who you are," says Bertaccini, executive chef and owner of IL TOCCO and Culinary Mischief. 

Bertaccini has made a splash in the Valley hosting secret events. With his concept of Culinary Mischief, 30 guests are invited to an undisclosed location to enjoy a six-course gourmet dinner that's paired with six outstanding wines. "It is these 'underground' dining experiences that put us on the map," says Bertaccini. "For each event, I change the location, the theme, the look, the wines, the food, everything," explains Chef Gabe. "It's like opening a new restaurant every month." 

Started in 2009, the concept remains the same: 30 guests, six courses, six wines. The event is posted and then the requests come pouring in. As many as 300 responses are reviewed to finalize the guest list down to 30 invites. Just three days prior to the scheduled event, the location is revealed to those fortunate enough to be included. Everything else - including the menu, the fellow diners and wine selections - is kept a secret until the evening gets underway. 

Pristine ingredients and simple execution are the keys to Bertaccini's food preparation, but his passion and creativity go deeper. "I have respect for the ingredients, but it's much more than that. It's great ingredients with a story," he explains. "I'm not only in the business of making great food; I'm in the business of making great memories... that's what it is all about."

Creating a memorable evening is what separates Chef Gabe from the rest. The meal rivals that of any five-star restaurant. The wines are varied and perfectly complemented to each course. The location is often unique and unexpected, and an added bonus is meeting new people. He calls it a "360 degree experience." 

Bertaccini is currently inviting guests into the "Chef's Den" where 12 guests come together to enjoy a five-course dinner paired with five wines. "I want to create an event and meal that speaks to my guests... a feast for the eyes, not only the palette. The moment my guests walk in, I want them to feel transported... I am able to transport people. It's so rewarding... to create moments people remember for the rest of their lives."
